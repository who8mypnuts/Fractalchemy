# HueClid
A fractal gradient editor and browser with aspirations. Perhaps one day it will be a full fractal editor.
For now, HueClid aims to be a gradient library and browser with the ability to edit, save, and convert gradient formats to a variety of fractal programs.

## Running

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Tests (headless, uses Qt's offscreen platform):

```bash
python -m pytest
```

## What it does today

### Library (left pane)
* Add folders with **+** (or *Edit ▸ Edit Library…* / the ✎ button, which lists every folder
  with its path, supported-file count and a ✕ to remove it). Folders persist between runs.
* The tree shows folders, supported files, and — for `.flame` / `.ugr` files holding several
  gradients — each named gradient as a child row. Click any file or gradient row to show it.
* Search box (debounced) matches file names **and** gradient names inside files; the ▲ button collapses the tree.
* Folders are watched (`QFileSystemWatcher`): files added, removed or rewritten by other programs show up
  automatically, and the open file is reloaded if it changes on disk and you have no unsaved edits.
* Right-click: Open, Copy, Paste, Duplicate, Rename, Delete, New Folder, Show in File Manager,
  Refresh, Remove from Library.
* Drag a gradient row onto another `.ugr` / `.flame` file to **move** it there (hold **Ctrl** to copy);
  onto a folder to create a new `.ugr` from it. Drag files between folders to move them.
* The arrow in the middle of the divider (or *View ▸ Show/Hide Library*, `Ctrl+L`) collapses the pane.
* Scanning, loading and every file operation run on a thread pool; the UI never blocks.

### Editor
* **Whole gradient** box: *Position* rotates the gradient (−200…200 = one full turn in 1/400 steps,
  nodes wrap around the ends); *Hue / Saturation / Luminance* shift every colour. Sliders and spin
  boxes are linked; values are always applied to the gradient as it was when you started adjusting,
  so dragging back and forth is lossless. Any other edit (dragging a node, the buttons, loading)
  bakes the adjustment in and returns the sliders to zero.
* *Randomize nodes* (new positions, colours kept), *Randomize node colors* (positions kept, colours drawn from a
  random harmony — analogous / complementary / triadic / split), *Reroll gradient* (new count, positions and
  colours), *Auto increase nodes* (2–6 harmonising colours), *Decrease nodes* (drops 25–50 %),
  *Smooth gradient* (blurs the colour curve and keeps only the nodes needed to reproduce it).
* *Copy gradient* puts the gradient on the clipboard as UGR text — the format Ultra Fractal's and
  Apophysis's gradient editors paste from. *Paste gradient* accepts the same text back (also a bare run of
  `index=/color=` tokens or a flame `<palette>`), replacing the current entry's nodes but keeping its name.
* **Selected node** box (right of the gradient, greyed out until a node is clicked): type a node number
  to select it; click the colour swatch for a movable, non-modal picker (hue/saturation wheel, H/S/L
  sliders, R/G/B and hex fields, before/after preview) that updates the gradient live — Cancel reverts.
  Position has a slider plus spin box in 0–399 (UF index) units; dragging past neighbours is allowed.
  *Add node* (same colour, midway to the next node), *Add random node*, *Randomize node* (nudges
  hue/saturation/lightness), *Delete node* (never below two nodes).
* Gradients are cyclic, as in Ultra Fractal / Apophysis: beyond the first/last node the colour
  blends across the wrap rather than clamping.
* The strip above the editor shows a thumbnail of **every gradient in the open file**; click one to edit it.
* **Save** (`Ctrl+S`) writes the gradient back into its own slot in the file and refreshes its thumbnail.
* **Save As ▾**: *Add to This File as New Gradient…* (`Ctrl+Shift+A`), *New File…* (`Ctrl+Shift+S`),
  or *Add to Another File…*. Afterwards the editor points at the saved location, so the next Save is in place.
  Flame gradients keep their fractal: a new entry or new file made from a flame clones the source `<flame>`
  (xforms, camera, …) under the new palette. Existing multi-gradient files are never overwritten by
  *New File…* — the gradient is saved into its own slot or appended instead.

* **Open** (`File ▸ Open…`, `Ctrl+O`) any of:

  | Format | Entries per file | Save in place | Add / remove entries | New file |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `.flame` (Apophysis / flam3) | one per `<flame>` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
  | `.ugr` / `.gradient` (Ultra Fractal gradients) | many | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
  | `.ufr` (Ultra Fractal fractal) | one per layer | ✓ | – | – |
  | `.map` (Fractint / UF palette) | one | ✓ | – | ✓ |
  | `.chaos` (Chaotica world) | one per IFS | ✓ | – | – |
  | images | one (extracted) | – | – | – |

  `.ufr` files are binary containers (header + parameter text + cached render); only the
  gradient section of a layer is rewritten and the header offsets are adjusted, so the
  cached pixels survive. A no-op save reproduces the file byte-for-byte.
  * images – dominant colours are extracted and ordered into a gradient:
    PNG / APNG (first frame), JPEG, AVIF, HEIC/HEIF, JPEG XL, WebP, GIF, BMP, TIFF,
    and SVG (rasterised via Qt). Transparent pixels are ignored.
* The gradient is painted in the editor with one **node** beneath each colour stop.
  Drag a node anywhere along the bar, including past other nodes; the others stay put.
* **Save** (`Ctrl+S`) writes back to the source file when it is a flame/ugr
  (for a flame, only the first palette block is rewritten; everything else is preserved).
  **Save As…** lets you pick `.flame` or `.ugr`. Image-derived gradients save as `.ugr`.

## Layout

```
main.py                 entry point only
ui/main_window.ui       Qt Designer layout (GradientEditor is a promoted custom widget)
hueclid/
  config.py             tunables: node counts, simplify tolerance, sizes
  model/                Qt-free data: colours, stops, Gradient, simplification, adjustments, node operations
  formats/              one module per file type + registry; textfile.py / ufparams.py do in-place text edits
  library/              roots (QSettings), scanner, model/filter/tree, controller, menus, dialog, panel
  imaging/              decoders/plugins, SVG rasteriser, palette extraction, colour ordering
  widgets/              GradientStrip, NodeBar, GradientEditor, position mapping
  ui/                   .ui loader, GradientDocument (state + signals), background tasks, file actions, MainWindow
tests/                  pytest suite
```

### Notes for tuning
* Flame and UF palettes contain 256 entries. On import, stops that a straight blend
  between their neighbours would reproduce within `IMPORT_SIMPLIFY_TOLERANCE`
  (per channel, 0–255) are dropped so the node bar stays usable. Set it to `0` to keep every stop.
* `IMAGE_COLOR_COUNT` controls how many nodes an image produces; `IMAGE_ORDERING`
  picks how they are sequenced (`path` = smooth nearest-neighbour walk from the darkest
  colour, or `luminance` / `hue`).
* All loaders already return *every* gradient in a file; only the UI picks the first.
* HEIC and JPEG XL need `pillow-heif` / `pillow-jxl-plugin`; if either is missing those
  extensions simply disappear from the Open dialog, and opening such a file by path
  reports which package to install.
